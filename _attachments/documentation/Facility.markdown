#Facility

(describe what happens when a case is found in)

The DMSO goes to the facility that reported the case. They will then look through the appropriate documents and registers to capture the required data.

Notes:

If a DMSO finds a case that they should have received a notification for, but have not, then they should help the health facility to report the notification immediately. Since the DMSO may not have internet access, and therefore are unable to download the just created notification, they can write down the case details on paper, and then add it to their tablet once it gets online and downloads the data. This will save them from having to visit the facility again.
