#Household

  3) After data is collected from the reporting facility, the DMSO will use the information to find the household here the patient lives. This usually involves calling the patient or going to the house of the Sheha to find the correct household. The following data is collected:

* Reason for visiting household
* Malaria Case ID
* Head of Household Name
* Shehia
* Village
* Sheha/Mjumbe
* Contact Mobile # (patient/relative)
* Household Location
* Number of LLIN
* Number of Sleeping Places (beds/mattresses)
* Number of Household Members with Fever or History of Fever Within Past Week
* Number of Household Members Treated for Malaria Within Past Week
* Index case: If patient is female 15-45 years of age, is she is pregant?
* Index case: Patient's current status
* Index case: Patient's treatment status
* Index case: Slept under LLIN last night?
* Last date of IRS
* complete

Note that the household location is captured using GPS technology. For this to work, the DMSO does not need an internet connection, but they do need a clear path to the sky. So the location should be captured standing outside in a clear area (not covered in trees if possible).
